# Overview
This is a volunteer project. It's purpose is to automate and digitize the processes for `Idreesia`, a non-profit organization. It is custom built to fulfill the requirements and process flows of the organization.

## Technologies
The front-end is built using React. Back-end is built on Meteor and MongoDB. GraphQL is used for communicating between the layers.

The front-end react code is currently a mixture of code using both HOC and hooks. Initially, all components were using HOC for data loading using GraphQL. After the introduction of React Hooks, it is being gradually ported over to use hooks.
